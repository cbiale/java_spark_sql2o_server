##	SparkJava + Sql2o + Jackson json

Tis is an example of how we can organize work with [SparkJava Web Framework](http://sparkjava.com/) and [Sql2o](http://www.sql2o.org/) database query library. Final result will be obtained as json string, using [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library.

Final result we can deploy on the [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) hosting using a simple [cartridge](https://github.com/gkiryaziev/spark-openshift-lightweight-cartridge).
